A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that 
specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of 
numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from 
the point to two fixed perpendicular directed lines, 
measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line 
is called a coordinate axis or just axis of the system, 
and the point where they meet is its origin, usually at 
ordered pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined 
as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the 
point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances 
from the origin.
Albania, officially known as the Republic of Albania, is
 a country in Southeastern Europe. It is bordered by 
Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, 
the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the 
south and southeast. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea 
to the west and on the Ionian Sea to the southwest. It is 
less than 72 km (45 mi) from Italy, across the Strait of 
Otranto which links the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.

Abcde, the first five letters of the Latin alphabet, is 
a rare feminine given name in the United States. The 
existence of the given name came to public attention in 
December 2014 due to a news story surrounding a 
seven-year-old girl with the name. This triggered the 
news portal Vocativ to look into the statistics of the 
given name. It turned out that 328 girls were named 
Abcde in the United States between 1990 and 2014. The 
name was given to 32 newly-born girls in the year 2009 
alone. The phenomenon seems to originate in Hawaii, 
where five Abcdes were born in 1990. The name later 
seems to have caught on among Hispanic American 
families, especially in New Mexico.
Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked.
In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads 
but now cover a wide range of preparations that can be 
simple or elaborate and share features with other desserts 
such as pastries, meringues, custards and pies.

Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, and butter 
or oil, with some recipes also requiring additional liquid 
(for example milk or water) and leavening agents (such as 
yeast or baking powder). Common additional flavourings 
include dried, candied or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa or 
extracts, and numerous substitutions for the primary 
ingredients are possible. Cakes can also be filled with 
fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced 
with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with 
marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial 
occasions, for example weddings, anniversaries, and 
birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are 
bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries 
old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; 
while at one time considerable labor went into cake making 
(particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment 
and directions have been simplified so that even the most 
amateur cook may bake a cake.
Cheesecake is a sweet dish consisting of one or more layers. 
The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, 
fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and 
sugar; if there is a bottom layer it often consists of a 
crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive 
biscuit), graham crackers, pastry, or sponge cake.[1] It 
may be baked or unbaked (usually refrigerated). Cheesecake 
is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored or 
topped with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, fruit sauce, and/or 
chocolate syrup. Cheesecake can be prepared in many flavors, 
such as; strawberry, pumpkin, key lime, chestnut, or toffee.
Def Leppard are an English rock band formed in 1977 in 
Sheffield as part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal 
movement. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Rick Savage 
(bass, backing vocals), Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick 
Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing 
vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). This 
is the band's longest-standing line-up.
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional 
support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal 
origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as fats, 
proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is 
ingested by an organism and assimilated by the 
organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or 
stimulate growth.

Historically, people secured food through two methods: 
hunting and gathering, and agriculture. Today, most of 
the food energy required by the ever increasing 
population of the world is supplied by the food 
industry.
